# 🤖 AI Diabetes Prediction App

This project uses artificial intelligence to predict the chance of diabetes using patient health data.

### How it works:
1. The model is trained with real medical data.
2. The app asks for patient info (like glucose, BMI, age).
3. It predicts if diabetes is likely or not.

### Files:
- `train_model.py` – trains the AI model  
- `diabetes_app.py` – runs the prediction app  
- `requirements.txt` – lists needed Python libraries

### To run:
streamlit run diabetes_app.py


Made with ❤️ using Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit.
